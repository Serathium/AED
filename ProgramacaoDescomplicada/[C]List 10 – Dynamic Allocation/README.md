# Exercises: Dynamic Allocation
1. Create a program that:

(a) Dynamically allocates an array of 5 integers,
(b) Asks the user to enter the 5 numbers in the allocated space,
(c) Displays the 5 numbers on the screen,
(d) Frees the allocated memory. [cite: 2]
2. Write a program that reads the size of a vector to be read from the user and performs dynamic memory allocation. [cite: 3] Then, read its values from the user and print the read vector. [cite: 4]
3. Write a program that reads the size of a vector to be read from the user and performs dynamic memory allocation. [cite: 5] Then, read its values from the user and show how many of the numbers are even and how many are odd. [cite: 6]
4. Write a program that receives the size of a string from the user and calls a function to dynamically allocate that string. [cite: 7] Then, the user must inform the content of this string. The program prints the string without its vowels. [cite: 8]
5. Write a program that reads a number N and:

* Dynamically creates and reads an integer vector of N positions; [cite: 9]
* Reads an integer X and counts and shows the multiples of this number that exist in the vector. [cite: 10]
6. Write a program that simulates a computer's memory: the user will specify the memory size, that is, how many bytes of integer type will be allocated. [cite: 11] For this, the requested memory must be a multiple of the integer type's size. [cite: 12] Then, the user will have 2 options: insert a value at a certain position or consult the value contained in a certain position. [cite: 13] The memory must start with all data zeroed. [cite: 14]

7. Write a program that first reads the 6 numbers generated by the lottery and then the 6 numbers on your ticket. [cite: 14] The program then compares how many numbers the player got right. [cite: 15] Then, it allocates space for a vector of size equal to the number of correct numbers and stores the correct numbers in this vector. [cite: 15] Finally, the program displays the drawn numbers and your correct numbers. [cite: 16]
8. Write a program to store in memory a data vector containing 1500 integer values, using the CALLOC dynamic memory allocation function: [cite: 17]

(a) Make a loop and check if the vector really contains the 1500 values initialized with zero (count the 1500 zeros in the vector). [cite: 17]
(b) Assign to each element of the vector the value of its index within this vector. [cite: 18]
(c) Display the first 10 and the last 10 elements of the vector on the screen. [cite: 19]

9. Write a program that reads any quantity of numbers, storing them in memory, and stops reading when the user enters a negative number. Then, print the read vector. Use the REALLOC function.

10. Write a program that asks the user how many values they want to store in a double vector, then use the MALLOC function to reserve (allocate) memory space according to what the user specified. [cite: 22] This vector must have a size greater than or equal to 10 elements. [cite: 23] Use this dynamic vector as a common vector, assigning random values (using the rand function) between 0 and 100 to the first 10 elements of the vector. Display the values stored in the first 10 elements of the vector on the screen. [cite: 24]

11. Create a program that declares a structure (record) for student registration. [cite: 25]
(a) For each student, the following must be stored: registration number, last name (only one), and year of birth. [cite: 26]
(b) At the beginning of the program, the user must inform the number of students that will be stored. [cite: 27]
(c) The program must dynamically allocate the necessary amount of memory to store the student records.
(d) The program should ask the user to enter the student information. [cite: 28]
(e) At the end, show the stored data and free the allocated memory. [cite: 29]

12. Consider a product inventory registration, with the following information for each product: [cite: 30]

* Product identification code: represented by an integer value
* Product name: with up to 50 characters
* Quantity available in stock: represented by an integer number
* Selling price: represented by a real value

(a) Define a structure, called product, that has the appropriate fields to store the information of a product.
(b) Create a set of N products (N is a value provided by the user) and ask the user to enter the information for each product.
(c) Find the product with the highest selling price.
(d) Find the product with the largest quantity available in stock. [cite: 31]

13. Write a program that dynamically allocates a matrix (of integers) of dimensions defined by the user and reads it. [cite: 31] Then, implement a function that receives a value, returns 1 if the value is in the matrix, or returns 0 if it is not in the matrix. [cite: 32]
14. Build a program that reads the number of rows and columns of a real number matrix, dynamically allocates space for it, and initializes it with values provided by the user. [cite: 33] At the end, the program should return the matrix to standard output with appropriate layout. [cite: 34]
15. Write a program that reads two numbers N and M and: [cite: 35]

* Creates and reads an $N \times M$ integer matrix;
* Locates the three largest numbers in a matrix and shows the row and column where they are.

16. Write a program that reads two numbers N and M: [cite: 37]

* Creates and reads an $N \times M$ integer matrix; [cite: 37]
* Creates and builds an $M \times N$ transposed integer matrix. [cite: 38]
* Shows both matrices. [cite: 38]
17. Write a program that reads numbers from the keyboard and stores them in a dynamically allocated vector. [cite: 39] The user will type a sequence of numbers, with no quantity limit. [cite: 40] The numbers will be typed one by one, and if the user wishes to end data entry, they will type the number ZERO. [cite: 41] The data must be stored in memory in this way: [cite: 42]

* Start with a dynamically allocated vector of size 10; [cite: 42]
* Then, if the allocated vector is full, allocate a new vector the size of the previous vector plus space for 10 more values (size $N+10$, where N starts at 10); [cite: 43]
* Copy the values already typed from the initial area to this larger area and free the memory of the initial area; [cite: 44]
* Repeat this procedure of dynamically expanding the allocated vector with 10 more values each time it is full. [cite: 45] Thus, the vector will be 'expanded' by 10 values at a time. [cite: 46]

At the end, display the read vector. [cite: 46] Do not use the REALLOC function. [cite: 47]

18. Write a program to dynamically allocate data blocks as requested below:

(a) Vector of 1024 Bytes (1 Kbyte). [cite: 47]
(b) Integer matrix of dimension 10 x 10. [cite: 48]
(c) Vector to store 50 records containing: product name (30 characters), product code (integer), and price in reais. [cite: 48]
(d) Text of up to 100 lines with up to 80 characters in each line. [cite: 49]
19. Write a program to associate names with the lines of a character matrix. [cite: 50] The user will inform the maximum number of names that can be stored. [cite: 51] Each name can have up to 30 characters with the '\0'. [cite: 52] The user can use 5 different options to manipulate the matrix: [cite: 53]

(a) Write a name in a line of the matrix; [cite: 53]
(b) Delete the name contained in a line of the matrix; [cite: 54]
(c) Inform a name, search for the line where it is located, and replace it with another name; [cite: 55]
(d) Inform a name, search for the line where it is located, and delete it; [cite: 56]
(e) Request to retrieve the name contained in a line of the matrix; [cite: 57]

20. Write a program that:

(a) Asks the user to enter the name and position (X and Y coordinates) of N cities and stores them in a vector of structures (N is informed by the user); [cite: 58]
(b) Creates a distance matrix between cities of size $N \times N$; [cite: 59]
(c) Calculates the distance between each two cities and stores it in the matrix; [cite: 60]
(d) Displays the obtained distance matrix on the screen; [cite: 61]
(e) When the user types the number of two cities, the program should return the distance between them. [cite: 62]

21. Write a program that reads four numbers a, b, c, and d, which will be the dimensions of two matrices, and: [cite: 63]

* Creates and reads a matrix, given its dimensions; [cite: 63]
* Creates and builds a matrix that is the product of two matrices. [cite: 64] In your main() function, print the two matrices and the product between them, if it exists. [cite: 65]
